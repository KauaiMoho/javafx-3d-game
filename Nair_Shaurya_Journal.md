# Shaurya's Journal

## Day 1, April 26, in class 30 min

<p> I learned how to access GitHub, and how to fetch, pull and push files from my local repository to GitHub I also learned how to use markdown
language, at least to an extent. </p>

## Day 1, April 26, at home 1 hour

> I added several classes, each to represent the materials that we're going to put into the game </p>

## Day 3, April 28, at home 1 hour

> I have added ore generation, and have made a function to pick ores randomly to add to the world. I also added code so they scroll with the world.

## Day 4, April 29, at home 20 min

> I increased the amount of ores that spawn, and I changed the y-level at which they spawn, so that now the ores are underneath the player.

## Day 4, April 29, in class, 45 min

> I changed the frequency for the ore spawn rate at different depths, so that the lower the player goes, the higher chance to find better materials. Also doubled the depth to which ores will spawn, and changed the frequency for that.

## Day 6, May 1st, at home, 35 min

> Changed an asset for the surface world, so that the vehicle will have a pad underneath it. Also changed the fade feature. Basically limits the FOV of the player. Will definitly need a revamp later onwards, but for right now, it looks alright.


## Day 7, May 2nd, at home, 2 hours

> Created two images. One for the fuel station, and one for the upgrade station (It really did take me two hours to do that). 

## Day 8, May 3rd, at home, 20 minutes

> Changed the image of the fade image, and changed the code so it's more realistic of a mechanic, and more practical for gameplay.

## Day 9, May 4th, at school, 10 minutes

> Made a X button image. Working on code to add it and give it functionality.

## Day 10, May 5th, at home, 20 minutes

> Added an ability to get the type of world an object is in. It doesn't work, but it's there.

## Day 11, May 6th, in class, 1 hour

> Added a corruption counter. Added diamondn and titanium ores, also added them to the ore generation.

## Day 14, May 9th, in class, 2 hours

> Altered an image of diamonds to make them look better. Added titanium and platinum. Also adding them to ore generation. 

## Day 15, May 10th, in class, 1 hour plus tutorial

> Made changes to some assets, and came up with the idea of an refinary. Ores need to be processed into proper materials before they can be used. I think that ores upto gold should require only coal to refine it, can then anything else requires coke, which is refined from coal. Also I intend to add refined versions, at least icons, of the materials.

## Day 15, May 10th, at home, 3 hours

> I spent this entire time making the refinery look as good as possible.


## Day 17, May 12th, at home, 4 hours

> Finishing the refinery image and adding the diamond drill image icon

## Day 18, May 13th, at school, 1 hour and 30 minutes

> Adding the refinery class and part of its functionality.

## Day 23, May 18th, at home, 2 hours

> Added multiple icons for the refinery.


## Day 24, May 19th, at home, 20 minutes

> Added the icons into the icon class.


## Day 25, May 19th, at home, 2 hours

> Added more code, and created some new assets. Can't commit it right now, code is broken.

## Day 26, May 20th, in class

> Spent all of the time in class working on the refinery hud

## Day 27, May 21st, at home, 1 hour

> Spent debugging, and changing my code. It works fine now.

## Day 28, May 22nd, at home, 1 hour 30 min

> Finally finsihed adding all of the code necessary for the refinery. There are no errors, it works as intnded.

## Day 29, May 23rd, at home, 5 mins

> Fixed a error with the refinery. I put the code in the wrong method, and I fixed it. 

## Day 32, May 26th, at home, 1 hour

> Made some assets for the convert fuel icons

## Day 35, May 29th, at home, 3 hours

> Made the multiple convert fuel buttons, one for each fuel type. Also changed the colors for the drill's finall, upgraded version to match the materials.

## Day 36, May 30, at home, 4 hours and 30 minutes
